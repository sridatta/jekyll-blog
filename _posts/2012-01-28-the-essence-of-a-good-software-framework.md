I was reading a [review of Backbone.js](http://www.decipherinc.com/n/blog/development-and-engineering-team/2011/04/backbone-api-and-events-models) when I came across a quote that anyone who is writing a software library or programming framework should keep in mind.

> I look at Backbone, and I say to myself, "Oh, this is code I've written, or wish I'd written only better reviewed and field-tested than the last ad-hoc implementation of this I came up with."

That's it. You don't need a boatload of features and configurability. A framework should abstract a task just enough that it's better than rolling your own version of it.
