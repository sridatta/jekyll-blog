<p class="p1">In my previous post, I use masculine pronouns to describe those in the tech industry. This is because "she/he" is an unwieldy construct and the singular "they" is grammatically questionable. I could make a concession and refer to them solely as "she" but tokenism can be easily recognized as such and distracts from the writing.</p>
<p class="p1">As long as masculine pronouns describe an alarming majority of my peers, I will use them. But I do hope that one day the word choice will not be as clear-cut.</p>
