<p>I have a tendency to wax philosophical on this blog so I am hoping to bring a new sense of pragmatism by posting "real-world" things such as code snippets and tutorials. To help with this, I've installed <a href="http://alexgorbatchev.com/SyntaxHighlighter/" target="_blank">a syntax highlighting script</a> on my page.</p>
<p>Let's see if this works:</p>
<pre class="brush: java; toolbar: false">public static void main(){
  System.out.println(&quot;Hello World&quot;);
}</pre>
