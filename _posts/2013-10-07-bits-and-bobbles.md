"Bits and bobbles" is a weekly, curated list of cool things I've seen people making on the Internet.

## 1. [Nootropics](http://www.gwern.net/Nootropics)
Could mind-altering drugs improve your personality and intelligence?
This guy takes a highly scientific approach and finds out.

## 2. [Puzzlescript](http://www.puzzlescript.net/documentation/rules101.html)
Puzzlescript lets you create full-featured 2D games in a 100%
declarative way. This isn't your grandfather's logic programming
language.

## 3. [Acme Text Editor](http://research.swtch.com/acme)
Acme is a text editor where all text is UI and all UI is text. This
means you can write scripts to generate GUIs to help you write scripts.
Invented by Rob Pike, the same guy who created Golang.

## 4. [Bullet Journal](http://tomtunguz.com/how-to-take-exceptional-notes-and-be-productive-with-paper)
One problem with being a hipster is you can't Ctrl-F in your Moleskine.
The "Bullet Journal" method of notetaking tries to solve this problem
without Post-It notes and color coding.
