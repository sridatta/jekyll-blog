"Bits and bobbles" is a weekly, curated list of cool things I've seen people making on the Internet.

## 1. [Foolproof Gardening](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2083391547/nourishmat-changing-the-way-wethink-about-food)
My dream is to have an automated vegetable garden which provides me all the produce I need. Projects like the 
[Nourishmat](http://modernfarmer.com/2013/07/nourishmat/) give gardening a better UI.

## 2. Spark and Mesos
Spark is a data processing framework that is meant to compete with Hadoop. There are [benchmarks that claim it is faster than Hadoop](https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/benchmark/), but what I really love is the [API doesn't make my eyes bleed](http://spark.incubator.apache.org/docs/latest/scala-programming-guide.html
).

Spark is loosely related to Mesos, a distributed job scheduler. Mesos takes a compute cluster and a list of jobs and schedules them efficiently. It can schedule [long-running](https://github.com/mesosphere/marathon/) and [periodic](https://github.com/airbnb/chronos) jobs. Nice.

## 3. [Open Source Bio Equipment](http://www.instructables.com/contest/buildmylab)

Cost of equipment makes biology prohibitively expensive for [scientists in the developing world](http://www.technologyreview.com/lists/innovators-under-35/2013/visionary/lina-nilsson/), or just curious hackers. Hacky yet effective open-source designs could bridge the gap.

## 4. [Xmonad for OSX](https://github.com/xmonad/osxmonad)
Xmonad is the grandaddy of tiling window managers. It finally has been extended to support Mac OS X. I already use [SizeUp](http://www.irradiatedsoftware.com/sizeup/) but I'm inclined to give this a try.
