        <h2><a href="http://getbridge.com">Bridge</a> <small>Flotype Inc.</small></h2>
        <p>
          Bridge is a revolutionary way to develop web applications. Through Bridge, developers can compose a custom service-oriented topology made of any variety of languages without having to worry about the underlying networking and serialization. On this project I worked on an Erlang connection handler as well as the Java and C++ clients.

        <h2><a href="http://nowjs.com">NowJS</a> <small>Flotype Inc.</small></h2>
        <p>
        NowJS makes it amazingly easy to build real-time web applications. It provides a shared namespace between the server and the client, allowing such magic as shared variables and remote procedure calls. NowJS quickly became one of the top libraries in the Node.js community due to its unprecendent simplicity, allowing you to write a chat server in 12 lines of code.
