<h2>On weird scary</h2>

<p>Grandpa Simpson: "I used to be with it, but then they changed what <em>it</em> was..."</p>

<p>(continued): "...Now what I'm with isn't <em>it</em>, and what's <em>it</em> seems weird and scary to me. It'll happen to you!"</p>

<p>RT @polemitis: Why do some folks think it is somehow a flaw if some people are only in BTC 'for the money / speculation'</p>

<h2>On full stack</h2>

<p>RT @cdixon: So many good tech ideas didn't work last decade because they tried to license to incumbents who didn't value or understand it.</p>

<p>RT @cdixon: Now the (excellent) trend is to go "full stack" and build tech, operations, and end user product/service to bypass incumbents.</p>

<p>RT @cdixon: Examples: electric car batteries, taxi operations systems, video delivery software, medical expert systems, educational softwar…</p>

<p>RT @cdixon: New world "full stack" startups: Tesla, Warby, Uber, Harrys, Nest, Buzzfeed, Netflix.</p>

<h2>On Every important new technology</h2>

<p>Market price of BTC (Bitcoin) dropped going into MtGox shutdown, and then has risen since.</p>

<p>This is exactly what one would predict for a normally functioning financial market without systemic risk.</p>

<p>MtGox had to die for Bitcoin to thrive. Its former role from early Bitcoin days has been supplanted by better, stronger entities.</p>

<p>People learning about or trading Bitcoin should deal with reputable, well-run, well-backed companies such as Coinbase (our choice).</p>

<p>Important to know that Bitcoin protocol &amp; transaction network doing just fine in wake of MtGox shutdown --&gt; no substantive technical issue.</p>

<p>Every important new technology has birthing pains. PC did, Web did, Bitcoin does. Our enthusiasm and commitment unchanged.</p>

<h2>On crucible high performance</h2>

<p>1/I'm torn over this story: "Inside the Showdown Atop Pimco, the World's Biggest Bond Firm" -- http://t.co/6ZwnN3uTbu</p>

<p>2/On the one hand, it's clearly excellent reporting, from top notch reporters and a world class newspaper.</p>

<p>3/On the other hand, story implication seems to be Bill Gross is out of control egomaniac who is going to ruin his firm if left unchecked.</p>

<p>4/I should start by saying I don't know Mr. Gross, I've never met him, I never deal with him in business, he's in totally different domain.</p>

<p>5/But the behavior described is completely typical of any highly-successful, high-functioning organization in any field I've ever seen.</p>

<p>6/High-functioning business organizations aren't Disneyland. There's always stress, conflict, argument, dissent. Emotion. Drama.</p>

<p>7/This exact same behavior/pattern is often found in both the best-performing companies in any space AND in the worst-performing.</p>

<p>8/I often see young people entering business think it's all going to be pattycake happyland, and if not, something must be badly wrong.</p>

<p>9/So I read this story and I literally think to myself, boy, that sounds like Apple, Oracle, Intel, Cisco, Google, Amazon, and Microsoft.</p>

<p>10/Moral? Business is stressful. There's constant conflict, emotion, even anger. Building a company is an intense experience, period.</p>

<p>11/Harnessed properly, this is the crucible out of which high performance and great results emerges. Satisfaction of overcoming challenges.</p>

<p>RT @John_Hempton: Bronte Capital: The really strange Comcast-Netflix deal http://t.co/1cZAvOCOeq $NFLX $VZ $CMCSA</p>

<p>RT @smc90: fascinating post on mobile app usage from @borthwick et al's iOS homescreen analysis [via @myoung] http://t.co/wgVEhr6Vwn</p>

<p>RT @nist: I'll go on record that this analysis of Facebook/WhatsApp will be proven very very wrong http://t.co/A1vkYRLu7Z</p>

<h2>On Later everyone</h2>

<p>Prompted by Net Neutrality topic, but not limited to Net Neutrality topic--also applies to health care, education, banking--speaking as VC:</p>

<p>Government regulation that purports to protect ordinary consumers generally ends up protecting large incumbents.</p>

<p>Because government regulation establishes high stickiness for incumbents, vs new entrants that are unequipped to handle regulatory load.</p>

<p>Large incumbents in any industry are well aware of this, so they play 2-sided game: simultaneously complaining about &amp; embracing regulation.</p>

<p>Which ultimately leads to regulatory capture--intertwined regulators &amp; incumbents; crazy high barriers to entry. http://t.co/UM26PUkY41</p>

<p>Therefore Dodd Frank = Big Banks Protection Act of 2010. Raised barriers to new banks. Result: Big banks more powerful than ever.</p>

<p>Sarbanes Oxley = Big Companies Protection Act of 2002. Raised barriers to new public companies. Result: # of public co's fell off a cliff.</p>

<p>Later, everyone wonders why there's no new competition, incumbents more powerful than ever, then calls for yet more protective regulation...</p>

<p>Then total surprise that regulated sectors of economy languish while more competitive sectors race ahead. Regular consumers are the victims.</p>

<p>It's utterly predictable, yet surprise every single time. Triumph of hope over experience--brought to you by the Good Intentions Paving Co.</p>

<h2>On competitive sharing</h2>

<p>Allee Effect: Phenomenon in biology -- positive correlation between population size/density and mean individual fitness within population.</p>

<p>[Citations: http://t.co/Itu3mrmznq, http://t.co/BdnW4WMcXQ]</p>

<p>Allee was able to demonstrate that goldfish grow more rapidly when there are more individuals within the tank.</p>

<p>Classical view: Due to competition for resources, population has lower growth rate at higher density &amp; higher growth rate at lower density.</p>

<p>Allee effect = positive density dependence; positive correlation between population density and individual fitness..."undercrowding".</p>

<p>Corollary?: # of tech startups targeting an established industry; more = higher odds of success for each?</p>

<p>Even if they're competing for scarce capital/talent, they'll make each other more competitive by sharing a playbook against common enemy?</p>

<h2>On surprising ]</h2>

<p>Red Queen hypothesis: Organisms adapt/evolve not only to gain advantage, also to survive vs evolving opposing organisms in changing context.</p>

<p>[Citations: http://t.co/lA2LvNX5zF, https://t.co/bCsAJrMhGr]</p>

<p>In many populations, the probability of extinction does not depend on the lifetime of the population.</p>

<p>In addition, the probability of extinction is constant over millions of years for a given population.</p>

<p>An adaptation of one species may change the selection pressure on another species, giving rise to an antagonistic coevolution.</p>

<p>The metaphor of an evolutionary arms race -- the description of biological processes with dynamics similar to arms races.</p>

<p>The ability of a family of organisms to survive does not improve over time -- [surprising] lack of correlation between age and extinction.</p>

<p>RT @trengriffin: @stevesi @pmarca @BenedictEvans Yes. Orthogonal to that: the increasing velocity of transfer of producer to consumer surpl…</p>

<p>RT @trengriffin: @pmarca @stevesi @BenedictEvans Certainly not captured in GDP figures. I see lost producer surplus in total profit adjuste…</p>

<h2>On long-dormant copy</h2>

<p>This is exciting for aficionados of the Voynich Manuscript: http://t.co/FwXylwDygz</p>

<p>Odds that a long-dormant copy of Wikipedia circa 2014 will be the Voynich Manuscript of 2614? --&gt; "What were they trying to tell us??"</p>

<h2>On key driver</h2>

<p>Thought experiment: 1-Wikipedia available to ~5 billion people globally (or soon). 2-Print version of Encyc Britannica cost $1,400 per copy.</p>

<p>So existence of Wikipedia (economic GDP value = ~zero) adding 5B * $1,400 = $7 trillion of new wealth to the world? Hmmm.</p>

<p>Corollary: Jimmy Wales (@jimmy_wales) &amp; colleagues biggest $ impact philanthropists ever? Leave JDRockefeller &amp; WHGates in dust? Hmmm.</p>

<p>RT @heathterry: @pmarca and my set of Britannica's never even had a fully detailed plot summary of the last 50 years of the X-Men.</p>

<p>Sam Altman (@sama) will undoubtedly take YC to even higher heights -- Paul Graham (@paulg) has picked the best possible successor.</p>

<p>And hat tip to Paul Graham (@paulg) for, with his colleagues, building the most amazing startup ecosystem in the world over last 10 years!</p>

<h2>On //t.co/cfwQ9q3QRW veil</h2>

<p>"Containing man’s relations to nature+society, &amp; incorp all skills+knowledge abt material creation+production, technology=very broad scope."</p>

<p>"However, Marx also observed that 'Right down to the eighteenth century, the different trades were called "mysteries."'"</p>

<p>"Then veil of mystery torn apart by 'modern science of technology,' science in which practical artists articulate &amp; explain their own work."</p>

<p>Citations: http://t.co/VDAN4PaAtL, http://t.co/cfwQ9q3QRW</p>

<h2>On political change</h2>

<h2>Idea 22</h2>

<p>The future of Hollywood: "On the set of the 'Veronica Mars' movie, a Kickstarter dream comes to life" -- http://t.co/dZhH282IHK</p>

<p>"Veronica Mars is back at work... in a project that has no business existing under any of the rules by which we understand Hollywood."</p>

<p>"The Film Shoot Brought to You By Kickstarter, crazy idea by the show’s creator Rob Thomas...$5.7 million crowdfunded dollars later..."</p>

<p>"Ivan Askwith, associate producer: 'These people gave money to a movie that didn’t even exist yet!'"</p>

<h2>On economic justice</h2>

<p>"World Protests 2006-2013" from @JosephEStiglitz's Initiative for Policy Dialogue -- http://t.co/PQCjw9fVaL</p>

<p>"There have been periods in history when large #'s of people rebelled about the way things were, demanding change -- 1848, 1917 or 1968."</p>

<p>"Today we are experiencing another period of rising outrage and discontent, and some of the largest protests in world history."</p>

<p>"A steady increase in the overall number of protests every year: from 2006 (59 protests) to mid-2013 (112 protests events in only 1/2 yr)."</p>

<p>"Main causes of outrage are: Economic Justice, Failure of Political Representation and Political Systems, Global Justice, Rights of People."</p>

<p>"Most sobering finding is overwhelming demand, not for economic justice per se, but for what prevents economic issues from being addressed:"</p>

<p>"Lack of 'real democracy', result of peoples' growing awareness that policy-making has not prioritized them, even when it has claimed to."</p>

<p>"Not only traditional protesters (activists, unions) demonstrating; middle classes, youth, older people are protesting in most countries."</p>

<p>"# of protests + # of protestors increasing. 37 events had 1M+ protesters; some may be largest protests ever (100M India '13, 17M '13)."</p>

<h2>On corrupt amp</h2>

<p>From one of the smartest thinkers I know--Kiril Sokoloff of 13D Research--http://t.co/tuD47mQ4Vz: "A contagion of social unrest &amp; violence."</p>

<p>"Ever-expanding list of countries down slippery slope towards chaos or civil war proves: a contagion will continue until proven otherwise."</p>

<p>"Long-suppressed anger in world starting to explode...caused by artificial borders, ethnic and religious hatred, accumulated anger..."</p>

<p>"...past wrongs, growing division bt haves &amp; have nots, corrupt &amp; poorly-led governments, inadequate economic growth, youth unemployment..."</p>

<p>"Growing speculation Ukraine may be headed for civil war. Thailand government being overthrown. Survival of Venezuela’s regime at risk..."</p>

<h2>Idea 26</h2>

<p>RT @johnofa: @pmarca Agree 100%.  That's where Orwell got it wrong https://t.co/W9MK4dleDE</p>

<p>RT @mathewi: @pmarca: Agreed -- I wrote about that a little here, inspired by @zeynep: http://t.co/70rIFOYZMt</p>

<p>RT @IvanTheK: @pmarca Harder to suppress dissent when people can congregate virtually in lieu of physically.</p>

<h2>On Every country</h2>

<p>My heart goes out to the people of Ukraine &amp; Venezuela--everyone in US hopes result of your struggles is peace &amp; freedom.</p>

<p>I think it's becoming increasingly clear: citizens of every country no longer willing to tolerate oppressive regimes, bad governments.</p>

<p>Contrary to cynicism in some quarters: Internet + smartphone + many other infotech innovations ramping power of citizens vs bad governments.</p>

<p>Prediction: Every country with bad government will have as many protests &amp; revolutions as needed to get to peaceful, prosperous democracy.</p>

<h2>On last year</h2>

<p>Amazing NYT piece on Sudan's version of "The Apprentice"--entrepreneurship is inspiring and driving ppl globally--http://t.co/329hRJu36d</p>

<p>"It was the final episode, live from Khartoum’s 18-story, egg-shaped Corinthia Hotel tower, built by Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi of Libya."</p>

<p>"...Has kindled imagination of Sudanese youth. Friends gathered to watch the evening episodes and rooted for their favorite contestants."</p>

<p>"'I followed the show from the beginning,' said Khalid Muhammad Khalid, 22, a university student. 'It was an inspiration.'"</p>

<p>"'Entrepreneurship is not culturally given a high status...Many would say, ‘Why not get a proper job in government or a company?'"</p>

<p>"Challenging that mind-set is what Mr. Abdelatif and several local businessmen sought out to do. Hence, the birth last year of 'Mashrouy.'"</p>

<p>"Chinese smartphone company, Xiaomi, has kicked off its global expansion plans in Singapore--Android devices will go on sale this Friday."</p>

<h2>On new world</h2>

<p>Responses to those 3 deflation questions prompted questions about ongoing role of Moore's Law especially if chip speeds are topping out.</p>

<p>My assessment for silicon: we are shifting from 30 years of "faster performance for same $" to 30 years of "same performance for less $".</p>

<p>Which means at least three dramatic changes in how we think about functionality &amp; performance of computing in our lives:</p>

<p>1: On a device (e.g. smartphone), rising use of parallelism (more cores and/or chips for same $), including graphics &amp; many new sensors.</p>

<p>2: In cloud, massive parallelism applied against many more big problems -- Google &amp; FB just the start; amazing new services in many sectors.</p>

<p>3: Ultra-cheap chips on network embedded in virtually every physical object around us; feeding info on real world + controlling real world.</p>

<p>User experience blends (1) Device in hand + (2) On-demand use of huge # of cloud supercomputers + (3) Online links to every physical object.</p>

<p>Most use cases for this new world were inconceivable in PC era. Literally no way to provide them -- couldn't be done; couldn't be imagined.</p>

<h2>On fly-by-night university</h2>

<p>Finally, serious economists are starting to take the time to study cryptocurrency &amp; Bitcoin beyond the cliches -- http://t.co/8xtBZWjI7v</p>

<p>"Athey believes...cryptocurrency is 'a simple, powerful technology superior to existing technology,' with major drivers for wide adoption."</p>

<p>"Even if everyone just broadcasting the fundamentals, a lot of new information about the fundamentals...not surprising value is changing."</p>

<p>"Athey says, 'When you really think about what we do today in the banking system...it's stunning that's the way we do business in 2014..."</p>

<p>"...It seems very natural that things will change. It's only surprising that they haven't changed already.'"</p>

<p>Economist quoted is Susan Athey, at some remote, probably unaccredited fly-by-night university called Stanford... https://t.co/CArK8Sna2I</p>

<p>For last 60 years, we've been doing dismount from every single one of these -- for what "normal" means. Still in process. Distance to go.</p>

<p>Theory: Internet is catalyst to finish the process. Each individual can find others alike; pressure to conform or alienate greatly reduced.</p>

<p>Result: Enormous reduction of societal alienation; corresponding enormous unlocking of human potential across all members of society.</p>

<p>Interesting @NickKristof column on growing marginalization/absence of academics from public issues/real world--http://t.co/oeftvJMFNQ</p>

<p>.@NickKristof says "Ph.D. programs have fostered a culture that glorifies arcane unintelligibility while disdaining impact and audience."</p>

<p>If true, then would expect smart academics who want real-world impact to increasingly leave academia, and e.g. start companies.</p>

<p>No tenure system in business world--"succeed or perish", not "publish or perish". Highly satisfying for personality type that wants impact.</p>

<p>For this reason, some universities making it much easier for profs &amp; grad students to leave &amp; return, even repeatedly. Controversial topic.</p>

<p>Delicate balance. Don't want to ruin what makes academia special. Do want to enable people to make maximum contribution to world.</p>

<h2>On every time</h2>

<p>Philosophy: New ideas (including new technologies) come from the fringe. Naturally--by definition, not going to come from establishment.</p>

<p>Since new ideas/technologies come from the fringe, they often also come with fringe politics attached.</p>

<p>In tech, this was true of both PCs and the Internet, both of which came with liberal/libertarian version of liberation theology attached.</p>

<p>In time, the new idea/technology mainstreams, leaving fringe politics behind. Mainstream politics adapts to accommodate new idea/tech.</p>

<p>Mainstreaming naturally alienates and embitters the original fringe political advocates, causing them to move on to other new ideas/tech.</p>

<p>In time, the original fringe politics are completely forgotten and the new idea/tech is viewed as normal and obviously inevitable.</p>

<p>"High rents on uncontrolled apartments (desperate renters w/nowhere to go) + absence of new construction despite high rents? Predictable."</p>

<h2>On vocal quality</h2>

<p>"With their bizarre shrubbery, Beatles are obviously a press agent's dream combo. Not even their mothers would claim that they sing well."</p>

<p>More WmFBuckley! "They qualify as crowned heads of anti-music, even as the imposter popes went down in history as 'anti-popes.'"</p>

<p>Newsweek: "Visually they are a nightmare, tight, dandified Edwardian-Beatnik suits and great pudding bowls of hair."</p>

<p>"Musically they are near disaster, guitars and drums slamming out merciless beat that does away with secondary rhythms, harmony and melody."</p>

<p>California transferred $336B <em>out</em> in 20 years; in comparison, Florida (e.g.) received $298B <em>in</em>. Consider difference in CA/FL state taxes!</p>

<p>New York, hotbed of greedy plutocrats, sent nearly $1 trillion <em>out</em> in 20 yrs; "real America" AZ, SC, WV, MI, KY, etc. received huge amts.</p>

<p>In %'s, Delaware, home of evil Fortune 500, overtaxed by 206%; New Mexico, salt of the earth people all, undertaxed by 261%.</p>

<h2>On new horizon</h2>

<p>In what year and in what context did Jack Dorsey (@jack) say the following: "We enter a new era. Are we ready for the changes coming?..."</p>

<p>"Houses we live in tomorrow will not much resemble houses today. Cars/planes/theaters/cities, industry itself, undergoing rapid changes..."</p>

<p>"Likewise, art in all its forms. The forms they presently take will undoubtedly have kinship with the forms we know in the present..."</p>

<p>"But this relationship will be as distinct/remote as that between the personal computer of yesterday and the present-day smartphone..."</p>

<p>"We live and work under pressure...We feel that life in our time is more urgent, complex and discordant than life ever was before..."</p>

<p>"In the perspective of fifty years in future, the historian will detect in the decade of 2010-2020 a period of tremendous significance..."</p>

<p>"She will see as period of criticism/unrest/dissatisfaction to point of disillusion when new aims being sought, new beginnings were astir."</p>

<p>"She will say, in midst of global melancholy due to economic depression, new age dawned with invigorating conceptions and horizon lifted."</p>

<p>"Critics of the age are agreed upon one thought: that what industry has given us, as yet, is not good enough."</p>

<p>"Another plea of critics hostile to the age is that machines make robots of men...They fail to see that the machine age is not really here."</p>

<p>"Although we built the machines, we have not become at ease with them and have not mastered them."</p>

<p>"Rapidly multiplying products, creating &amp; glorifying the gadget, we are inferior craftsmen, victims rather than masters of our ingenuity."</p>

<p>"The US has seized upon more of the fruits of technology than any other nation. We have gone farther and more swiftly...To what end?"</p>

<p>"Not the least tendency is the searching and brooding uncertainty, the quest for basic truths which characterize the present day."</p>

<p>"Never before, in an economic crisis, has there been such aroused consciousness on part of community at large and within industry itself."</p>

<p>"Complacency has vanished. A new horizon appears. A horizon that will inspire the next phase in the evolution of the age."</p>

<h2>On Entrepreneurial mindset</h2>

<p>Part 5: The opportunity for leadership in journalism business--just happens to be same leadership opportunity as in all businesses!</p>

<p>1 Vision--If "difference between vision &amp; hallucination is others can see vision", then critical to articulate bright future w/clarity.</p>

<p>2 Scrappiness--tough challenges call for resourcefulness, pragmatism, staying close to ground, in the details, all over opportunities.</p>

<p>3 Experimentation--May not have all the right answers up front, but running many experiments changes arguments to tests, data, correctness.</p>

<p>4 Adaptability--"Would you rather be right or successful?" top of mind at all times--the times change, we change--strong views weakly held.</p>

<p>5 Focus--As we gain clarity from experiments &amp; adaptation, then we focus on small # of ultra-clear goals; all wood/arrows; all hands/deck.</p>

<p>6 Deferral of gratification--stomach (and resources!) to reject near-term rewards for enduring success; in journalism=refuse race to bottom.</p>

<p>7 Entrepreneurial mindset--both in new co &amp; existing co--we own the company; we make the business; we control our future; it's on us.</p>

<h2>On national news</h2>

<p>Recap of journalism business tweetstorm to date: Part 1-My optimism about future of news; 2-How to make $ in news; 3-People doing it right.</p>

<p>Part 4: Things &amp; ideas in journalism business, probably/arguably counterproductive to twin growth of quality journalism + quality business.</p>

<p>1 Bloated cost structure left over from monopoly/oligopoly days. Nobody promised shiny HQ tower, big expense accounts, lots of secretaries!</p>

<p>2 Unions &amp; Pensions: Useful once, but now impose structural rigidity in rapidly changing environment. Everyone with equity = better model.</p>

<p>3 "Objectivity" as only model. Still relevant for some, but broad journalism opportunity includes many variations of subjectivity.</p>

<p>Pre-WWII, subjectivity was the dominant model--lots of points of view battling it out in marketplace of ideas; many approaches 2 same topic.</p>

<p>My take: "Objectivity" post-WWII was artifact of new monopoly/oligopoly structures; necessary to ward off antitrust; embraced by reporters.</p>

<p>But is only one way to tell stories &amp; get at truth. Many stories don't have "two sides"; describing with point of view can even be better.</p>

<p>4 "Chinese wall" between content &amp; business; no other non-monopoly industry lets product creators off the hook on how the business works.</p>

<p>There are intermediate points between "holier than holy" and "hopelessly corrupt" that don't equal warped coverage and do work as business.</p>

<p>Many businesses balance incentives &amp; conflicts all day long; can still hold line on quality, make great products. Many ways to skin cat.</p>

<p>5 Spent 90% of effort on playing defense/protecting old, vs strong offense/making the future. In long run, bad result is inevitable.</p>

<p>Even newspapers that are now making it across digital chasm would be much better off today if had shifted resources/focus harder/sooner.</p>

<p>Best approach to strategy is think like 100% owner with long-term time horizon, and then work backward. Versus what we have now forward.</p>

<p>6 News industry with excessive # of competitors. 15 full-scale US national news orgs plus more from int'l too many; consolidation required.</p>

<p>NYT, WSJ, WP, LAT, CT, NBC, CBS, ABC, PBS, NPR, Reuters, AP, CNN, Bloomberg, BBC, FT, Guardian, etc + all online co's too many general orgs.</p>

<h2>On different look</h2>

<p>My friend @rehundt saw Beatles live in Washington 50 years ago today--1st live concert after Ed Sullivan TV event. http://t.co/ApC7UQJ72t</p>

<p>These are original photos taken at the event by his friend/classmate Peter. http://t.co/sVZ2DU5YDs</p>

<p>The thing to remember is what absolute panic this caused in the minds of parents throughout US at the time. http://t.co/3ovXY2OPqC</p>

<p>WmFBuckley review at time: "Not merely awful...they are god awful...unbelievably horrible, appallingly unmusical..." http://t.co/L5jRPA35OX</p>

<h2>On Books/Business amp</h2>

<p>RT @cdixon: "A brainwallet refers to the concept of storing Bitcoins in one's own mind by memorization of a passphrase" https://t.co/7qOiOv…</p>

<p>RT @amazon: @bhorowitz The Hard Thing About Hard Things is in the top 100 in Books/Business &amp; Investing on Amazon! http://t.co/jbBRJy3xH4</p>

<h2>On competent technical coverage</h2>

<p>Plus great to see @nytimes has evidently cracked code on print-&gt;digital after hard effort; http://t.co/Ftolr0aaaW http://t.co/m5Jew5P5UT</p>

<p>Finally, note not every experiment will work--maybe even some of these won't work. Not the point. Experiments needed for creation, success.</p>

<p>.@wirecutter (@blam)--A mini gadget news empire from various beach locales. A new style of tech journalism, side effect of great data.</p>

<p>.@TheAtlantic (@1bobcohn)--Taking a long-lived and respected brand and blowing it out worldwide. A daily presence now &amp; growing audience.</p>

<p>.@VICE (@shanesmith30)--From online Do's and Don't's now to Vice media empire. Growth and presence via online stories &amp; especially video.</p>

<p>.@WIRED (@sdadich)--Now more than half of revenue comes from digital, and growing. Blending print + digital; amazing breadth + depth.</p>

<p>.@sengineland (@dannysullivan)--All the search news, all the time. Leveraged into live events and consulting gigs. A new model for digital.</p>

<p>.@BuzzFeed (@peretti) -- Buzzfeed firehose created with listicles, now doing amazing in-depth long-form journalism. Growing like banshee.</p>

<p>.@politico (@harrispolitico)--Has taken over as the first thing DC reads every morning. Virtues of aggressive online focus demonstrated.</p>

<p>.@anandtech (@anandshimpi)--Monstrously competent technical coverage of computing industry; unprecedented depth + detail. Big influence.</p>

<p>.@verge (@joshuatopolsky)--Full coverage of tech industry news; daily must read. Crosses tech+consumer audiences. Expect 10x larger in 5yrs.</p>

<h2>On every customer</h2>

<p>For public co/modern era, everything connected: stock price, customer receptivity, morale &amp; talent flows, press coverage, ecosystem trust.</p>

<p>As result:Public co tends to either positive feedback cycle where everything works well, or negative feedback cycle where everything is bad.</p>

<p>Therefore momentum -- in overall sense -- has become key: leads to either compounding goodness or compounding badness.</p>

<p>I think role of momentum &amp; stock price as judge really intensified around 1996, due initially to widespread use of Yahoo Finance.</p>

<p>Before 1996/Yahoo Finance, even most sophisticated people had only vague, general awareness of most public companies &amp; how they were doing.</p>

<p>After 1996/Yahoo Finance, every customer, employee, recruit, reporter, analyst, supplier, distributor checks co stock price daily = judging.</p>
